        description: "A daily expense tracker web app. It utilizes NLP for automated expense entry from simple text or voice inputs about the spending. Innovated expense tracking by adding psychological triggers into categorization to identify user spending behaviors. Crafted a Logistic Regression & Bi-LSTM Model to extract categories of 1000+ expenses and spending behavior of the user. Integrated Promt Engineering by fine-tuning the OpenAI model to generate financial summary for an user.",
