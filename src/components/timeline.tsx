                        When was the last time you encountered someone who could draw parallels between hip-hop dance and data science? 
                        For me, dance is not just a hobby; it&apos;s a dynamic expression of creativity, rhythm, and precisionâ€”qualities I also bring to my passion for data analysis and data science.

                            Hi, I&apos;m Ayan. I draw beautiful insights and conclusions from boring numerical and textual
                            data. I love to explore modern trends in the field of data science and applying those to 
                            make my life a bit easier. I have been playing around with data since 2022.
